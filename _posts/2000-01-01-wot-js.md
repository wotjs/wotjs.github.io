# WoT.JS
WoT.JS is a library provides a easy and fast way to build IoT([Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)) applications for hackers. You just can control devices so easily like doing programming with pure Web technology.

## Concepts
* A device is represented as a element in a DOM tree.
* A Web app is just an IoT app, hackers can control multiple devices in it.
* Only JavaScript code, no native(C/C++) code to build an IoT app.

## Brief Look
Light a LED without code.
